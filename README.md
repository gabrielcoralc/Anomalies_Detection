# Anomalies_Detection

 Usign ARIMA predictive model and Isolation Forest algorithm to find anomalies in time series.
 
The explanations and the use of each method is commented on the notebooks found in this repository.

Two databases were used, one with daily information and the other with hourly information, both are inside the data folder.

The visualizations were made in plotly since they provide greater interactivity to the final user, so it is necessary to execute the code to be able to observe the results, below is an example with the last results that were executed in the jupyter notebook:
